# facturacion_train
Is a PHP and Angular JS simple application, connection with SQLServer and Oracle. This project was an integration between 2 systems and databases.

The database configuration is under /include folder

Under /ajax folder you will find the all the individual php files that are used as GET/POST requests from app.js . This project was develop several year ago and I don't see the point of changing the backend to something more elegant like RESTful API.
